# Slot11_Intro-to-ML

## Description
This repository has been created for my PESU IO course Introduction to Machine Learning. This course spans four weeks and covers the various topics listed below.

### Week 1 [Linear Regression]
In week 1 we go over simple linear regression and execute two examples. In the first example code, we generate our own dataset by using the random function within numpy. In the second example, we utilize the wine quality dataset on UCI Machine Learning repository and perform linear regression on it.

### Week 2 [Support Vector Machines]
In wee 2 we learn about a popular classification algorithm: support vector machines. We utilize the breast-cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository to classifiy and predict the two categories of breast cancer.

### Weeek 3 [Neural Networks]

### Week 4 [K-means]
